## Introduction

In a world where data security is paramount, this project aims to provide a robust framework for secure file transfers using certificate-based authentication. By leveraging the power of OpenSSL certificates, we ensure that only authorized devices can communicate with the server, and all data exchanged remains confidential.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- OpenSSL 1.1.1 or higher

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Generate necessary SSL certificates using OpenSSL.
3. Configure the server and client scripts with appropriate file paths, IPs, and ports.
4. Run the server script on the designated server.
5. Run the client script on authorized client machines.

## Features

1. **Message Sharing**: Establish secure communication between the server and clients to exchange messages.

2. **Text File Transfer**: Safely transfer text files from one device to another while ensuring data integrity.

3. **Multimedia Transfer**: Share multimedia files (e.g., mp3 files) securely, maintaining the confidentiality of your media content.

4. **IP Blocking**: Prevent unauthorized access by configuring IP restrictions, allowing only whitelisted IPs to communicate with the server.

## Security Measures

- **Certificate-Based Authentication**: Utilize SSL certificates to establish trust between the server and clients, preventing unauthorized access.

- **Data Encryption**: All data transferred between the server and clients is encrypted, ensuring confidentiality.

- **IP Whitelisting**: Implement IP-based access control to restrict communication to trusted devices only.

- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling mechanisms are in place to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.

## Usage
